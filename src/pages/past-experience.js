        My Experience
      </h3>
      <p className="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-400">
        I did my master&apos;s in IT and Business, so when I joined my current
        company I wore too many hats from day one. I capitalized on my designing
        and business skills and the end product that my team and I have created
        speaks volumes. At my current company, I have had the freedom to make
        decisions, decide the direction of the product and add/remove features
        as I want. My company directors have certainly enjoyed the autonomy they
        gave me as our product raked in close to A$200K in profits within 3
        quarters from launch.

        The Future for Me
      </h3>
      <p className="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-400">
        Everything counts or nothing counts. I love learning absolutely
        everything because every bit of knowledge and skill pays off one way or
        the other. At Vercel, I&apos;d love to learn and focus more on the
        business / management / corporate side. While a lot of VC-backed firms
        have failed and or are failing, Vercel seems to be getting bigger and
        better! This means it&apos;s doing something right and I&apos;d love to
        know the
        <span className="font-semibold"> how&apos;s</span> and the{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">why&apos;s</span>. I am super keen on
        the idea of working at Vercel because of its diverse team throughout the
        globe. There's never going to be a better chance to upskill and learn
        from my peers.

        Impactful Marketing
      </h3>
      <p className="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-400">
        In terms of the positive impact, I do like what Kent and the team are
        doing with the Remix website. The whole scroll to showcase section and
        'while you were waiting...' etc. is quite compelling. I bet the
        frontend/design teams at Vercel have already reverse engineered that
        bit, but I'd still put the link{" "}
        <a
          className="text-blue-600 font-semibold"
          href="https://remix.run"
          target="_blank"

          here.
        </a>{" "}
      </p>
      <p className="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-400">
        Another one would be{" "}
        <a
          className=" text-blue-600 font-semibold"
          href="https://www.productboard.com"
          target="_blan k"
        >
          Productboard
        </a>
        . Their site is quite nice, but it's the bite-size videos that provide
        you the quintessence of Productboard, and they are quite nicely
        produced.
