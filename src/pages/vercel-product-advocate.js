              As a product advocate, I think it would be pertinent if I jumped
              on to call with potential customers and show them everything
              possible with Next.js and Vercel. I do know Next.js and the way it
              works under the hood, and it would be exciting to explain to
              potential clients.

              Coming from a design and business background, I am painfully
              meticulous about brand identity, the tone of addressing customers,
              and the CX. I have spent countless hours creating a language
              framework for our customer-facing staff at my current employment.
              The framework included all the possible scenarios, from answering
              even the most naive customer queries professionally to diffusing
              and handling frustrated, angry customers.

              Nothing is ever perfect, and there is no time to settle. We are

              and workflows should be perpetually improved. Period.

              I have tried to empathize with customers at my current job, and I
              realized that it limits my objectivity to the situation. As a PM /

              business interests too. <br />

              I code for fun in my free time and I use a lot of open-source

              leniency towards a project/plugin/framework I like.
